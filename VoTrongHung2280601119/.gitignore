# Common generated files for .NET/C# projects
# If your .csproj.user or .vscode folder also create local settings you don't want to commit, add them
# For example:
# *.csproj.user
# .vscode/

# Example of appsettings.json handling:
# If appsettings.json contains sensitive info or local-only configs:
# appsettings.json
# appsettings.*.json # Wildcard for environment-specific configs
#
# If you need appsettings.json to be tracked and resolve conflicts manually, then DO NOT add it here.
# Otherwise, if it's meant to be local/ignored, then add it.
